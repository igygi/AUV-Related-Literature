1. Mask R-CNN - He, Gkioxari, Dollar, Girschick (FAIR) - ICCV 2017
   - extends the Faster R-CNN architecture by adding a mask branch for instance segmentation; in addition, uses RoIAlign instead of RoIPool, resulting to better object detection performance

2. R-FCN-3000 at 30fps - Decoupling Detection and Classification - Singh, Li, Sharma, Davis - CVPR 2018
   - decouples object detection and classification by using 'superclasses' for object detection
   - the classifier is then applied on regions that pass a certain threshold, based on the object detection results
   - objectness score and classification score are then multiplied to obtain the final class probabilities
