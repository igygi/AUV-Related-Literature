1. Mask R-CNN - He, Gkioxari, Dollar, Girschick (FAIR) - ICCV 2017
   - extends the Faster R-CNN architecture by adding a mask branch for instance segmentation; in addition, uses RoIAlign instead of RoIPool, resulting to better object detection performance
   - repository: https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron
   
2. R-FCN-3000 at 30fps - Decoupling Detection and Classification - Singh, Li, Sharma, Davis - CVPR 2018
   - decouples object detection and classification by using 'superclasses' for object detection
   - the classifier is then applied on regions that pass a certain threshold, based on the object detection results
   - objectness score and classification score are then multiplied to obtain the final class probabilities

3. Path Aggregation Network for Instance Segmentation - Liu, Qi, Qin, Shi, Sia - CVPR 2018
   - introduces 3 major improvements over Mask R-CNN namely, bottom-up path augmentation, adaptive feature policy, and fully connected fusion in mask reduction
   - bottom-up path augmentation connects low-layer information to higher-layer information for better information propagation
   - adaptive feature policy pools features from different levels since large (small) proposals may benefit from accessing low (high)-level features
   - fully connected fusion adds a fully connected layer to the mask prediction branch (originally contains just an FCN) since fc layers are location sensitive, allowing the model to adapt to different spatial locations
